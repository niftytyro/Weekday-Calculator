This is a c++ program that calculates the weekday given a particular date in history or future tarting from Year 1;
The idea is based upon the principle that after every 7 days, the weekday is same;
So we calculate the total number of days between the given days and the epoch, i.e., 
1 January 2020
and find the number of times the week-day will be changed by performing a simple operation:
                
                
            total days % 7


This gives us the number times the weekday has to be changed.
Simple. ;)
